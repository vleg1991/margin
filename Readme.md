This is a technical test task project.<br>
Application purpose is compting benifit of selling of USD relative to the RUB exchange rate.<br>
As resource of data about currecy USD exchange rates, here I'm using API Yandex (news.yandex.ru).<br>

If you want to run application use IDE for a project building.<br>
Also project uses <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Lombok</a> lib, if it nessesary you should "Enable Annotation Processing" (for a IDEA <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/compiler-annotation-processors.html">Annotation processing</a>).
Finally, project runs via "bootRun" task without arguments.
